/* 
 * Package: dispatch.js
 * 
 * Namespace: amigo.data.dispatch
 * 
 * This package was automatically created during an AmiGO 2 installation
 * from the YAML configuration files that AmiGO pulls in.
 *
 * The mapping file for data fields and contexts to functions, often
 * used for displays. See the package <handler.js> for the API to interact
 * with this data file.
 *
 * NOTE: This file is generated dynamically at installation time.
 * Hard to work with unit tests--hope it's not too bad. You have to
 * occasionally copy back to keep the unit tests sane.
 *
 * NOTE: This file has a slightly different latout from the YAML
 * configuration file.
